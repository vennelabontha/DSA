A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
It operates like a line where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).

Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure

->Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
->Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
->Peek: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
->Empty: Checks if the queue is empty.
->Full: Checks if the queue is full
