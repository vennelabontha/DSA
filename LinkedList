#Linked List
In Java, a LinkedList is a collection class that can contain multiple elements of the same type. 
It is part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the List interface, similar to ArrayList.
Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. 
Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node
Node Structure: A node in a linked list typically consists of two components:

1.Data: It holds the actual value or data associated with the node.
2.Next Pointer or Reference : It stores the memory address (reference) of the next node in the sequence.

Head and Tail: The linked list is accessed through the head node, which points to the first node in the list. 
The last node in the list points to NULL or nullptr, indicating the end of the list. This node is known as the tail node.

Types of linked lists: 
There are mainly three types of linked lists:
1-Single-linked list
2-Double linked list
3-Circular linked list
